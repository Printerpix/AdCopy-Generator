        A/B testing revealed that using customer testimonials in video ads increased click-through rates by 34% compared to product-focused content. The testimonials featured real customers discussing specific problems the product solved. This approach worked particularly well for B2B software companies targeting decision-makers.

        Dynamic product ads with personalized recommendations based on browsing history generated 2.3x higher conversion rates than static catalog ads.

This strategy worked best for e-commerce brands with diverse product catalogs but showed limited success for single-product companies.
